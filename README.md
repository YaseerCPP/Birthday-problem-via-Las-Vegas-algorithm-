The birthday problem, also known as the birthday paradox, is a famous problem in probability theory. It deals with the probability that, in a group of people, at least two individuals will have the same birthday. Despite the seeming unlikelihood, the probability reaches 50% with a surprisingly small group of just 23 people.

Basic Concept
The birthday problem asks: How many people must be in a room to have a better than even chance (greater than 50%) that at least two of them share the same birthday?

Assumptions
1. Each year has 365 days (ignoring leap years for simplicity).
2. Birthdays are uniformly and independently distributed across these days.
